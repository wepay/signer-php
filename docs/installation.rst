Installation
============

`Composer`_ is the only method for installation that our team will support.
Other installation methods may be used at your own risk.

Using `Composer`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require wepay/signer-php=^1.0

And include it in your scripts:

.. code-block:: php

    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

.. _Composer: http://getcomposer.org
